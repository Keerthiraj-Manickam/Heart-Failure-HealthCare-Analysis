# Heart Failure Analysis Dashboard

## Overview
The **Heart Failure Analysis Dashboard** provides a comprehensive analysis of survival and mortality rates in heart failure patients. Built using Tableau, this dashboard visualizes the relationships between survival status and critical health factors, including demographics, lifestyle habits, and laboratory measures.

## Contents and Visualizations
1. **Anaemia - Survival Status**  
   - Donut chart showing survival rates for patients with and without anaemia.  

2. **Diabetes - Survival Status**  
   - Donut chart displaying survival and death rates for diabetic and non-diabetic patients.  

3. **High Blood Pressure - Survival Status**  
   - Donut chart depicting survival trends for patients with and without high blood pressure.  

4. **Smokers - Survival Status**  
   - Donut chart analyzing survival outcomes for smokers and non-smokers.  

5. **Gender - Survival Status**  
   - Donut chart showcasing survival and mortality based on gender (male vs. female).  

6. **Age - Survival Status**  
   - Histogram showing the age distribution of patients who survived versus those who died.  

7. **Creatinine Phosphokinase - Survival Status**  
   - Histogram illustrating the relationship between creatinine phosphokinase levels and survival outcomes.  

8. **Age-Sex-Survival Status**  
   - Boxplots comparing survival across age groups and genders.  

9. **Platelets - Survival Status**  
   - Histogram analyzing the survival outcomes based on platelets count.  

10. **Ejection Fraction - Survival Status**  
    - Histogram displaying the impact of ejection fraction (heart function measure) on survival.  

11. **Serum Sodium - Survival Status**  
    - Histogram correlating serum sodium levels with survival rates.  

12. **Time - Survival Status**  
    - Histogram showing survival outcomes over time since diagnosis.  

13. **Age-Time-Survival Status**  
    - Scatterplot illustrating the relationship between age, survival status, and time since diagnosis.  

## Top-Level Metrics
- **Total Individuals**: 299  
- **Total Deaths**: 96  
- **Average Age**: 60.83 years  

## Interactivity
- **Filters**:  
  - Users can filter the visualizations by **gender** to focus on specific subsets of data.


## Insights
- Anaemia, diabetes, high blood pressure, and smoking significantly influence survival rates.  
- Gender-specific survival differences highlight a need for personalized healthcare strategies.  
- Key laboratory measures such as **creatinine phosphokinase**, **platelets**, and **ejection fraction** are critical predictors of survival.  


## Design Features
- Dark-themed dashboard for enhanced visual contrast and readability.  
- Interactive elements for dynamic exploration of the data.  
- Combination of donut charts, histograms, scatterplots, and boxplots to cater to different analytical needs.  


## How to Use
1. Open the dashboard in Tableau Desktop or Tableau Public.  
2. Interact with filters to explore survival statistics based on different demographics and health parameters.  
3. Analyze various graphs and distributions to gain insights into the survival trends.  


## Future Enhancements
- Adding predictive analytics using machine learning models.  
- Incorporating additional health parameters for deeper analysis.  
- Integrating real-time data sources for dynamic updates.
